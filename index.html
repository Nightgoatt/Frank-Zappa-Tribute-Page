        Frank Vincent Zappa (December 21, 1940 – December 4, 1993) was an American multi-instrumentalist musician,
        composer, and bandleader. His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound
        experiments,
        musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed
        rock,
        pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrète works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums
        that
        he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length
        films
        and music videos, and designed album covers. He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically
        diverse
        rock musicians of his era.
        <br></br>
        As a self-taught composer and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences led him to create music that was
        sometimes difficult to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical modernism,
        African-American rhythm and blues, and doo-wop music. He began writing classical music in high school, while at
        the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands, later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album
        with the Mothers of Invention, Freak Out!, combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective
        improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach whether
        the fundamental format was rock, jazz, or classical.
